    Sure! Let's elaborate on **point 7: Scoped Values (Preview)**, one of the new features introduced in Java 21.

### Scoped Values (Preview)

#### Overview
Scoped values provide a mechanism for associating values with scopes in a program. This feature enables better control over how values are accessed and modified across different parts of an application, improving readability and maintainability.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Scope**:
   - A scope is a well-defined context within a program where a variable is accessible. In the context of scoped values, it typically refers to a block of code, a method, or a lambda expression.

2. **Scoped Value**:
   - A scoped value is a value that is associated with a specific scope. It can be accessed and modified only within that scope, ensuring that its usage is localized and controlled.

3. **Read-Only Access**:
   - Scoped values are designed to be read-only within their scope, ensuring that they cannot be modified once they are set. This immutability enhances safety and reduces the risk of unintended side effects.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - Scoped values are particularly useful in scenarios where values need to be passed through multiple layers of an application without using global variables or complex parameter passing. They help in maintaining clear and predictable data flow.

### Example Usage
Here's an example illustrating how scoped values can be used in Java:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ScopedValueExample {
    // Defining a scoped value
    private static final ScopedValue<String> currentRequestId = new ScopedValue<>();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        // Setting scoped values in different scopes
        executor.submit(() -> {
            currentRequestId.set("Request-1");  ///NOTAR Q EL VALOR "Request-1" ES SOLO VALIDO DENTRO DEL SCOPE QUE EN ESTE CASO ES LA FUNCION LAMBDA
            processRequest();
        });

        executor.submit(() -> {
            currentRequestId.set("Request-2"); ///NOTAR Q EL VALOR "Request-2" ES SOLO VALIDO DENTRO DEL SCOPE QUE EN ESTE CASO ES LA FUNCION LAMBDA
            processRequest();
        });

        executor.shutdown();
    }

    private static void processRequest() {
        // Accessing the scoped value
        String requestId = currentRequestId.get();
        System.out.println("Processing " + requestId);
    }
}
```

### Benefits

1. **Immutability**:
   - Scoped values are immutable within their scope, promoting safer and more predictable code.

2. **Clarity**:
   - Scoped values clarify the intent by localizing the value's usage to a specific scope, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

3. **Avoids Globals**:
   - Helps avoid the pitfalls of global variables, which can lead to unexpected behavior and difficulties in debugging.

4. **Thread Safety**:
   - Scoped values can be used to manage thread-specific data, ensuring that each thread has its own isolated view of the value.

### Summary
Scoped values in Java 21 provide a powerful way to manage values within well-defined scopes, enhancing code safety, readability, and maintainability. By offering a clear and immutable mechanism for associating values with scopes, they help reduce complexity and improve the overall quality of the codebase.
